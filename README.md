#  Atliq Hardware Sales Insights (Power BI)

##  Project Overview
This is a **self-initiated data analytics project** where I analyzed Atliq Hardwareâ€™s sales and profitability data using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to build an **end-to-end BI solution** for revenue tracking, customer analysis, and profitability insights.  
(Data source: `db_dump.sql` was imported into Power BI, cleaned, and modeled using Power Query & DAX.)
